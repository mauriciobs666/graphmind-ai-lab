## Active

| ID | Added | Priority | Status | Summary |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| K-001 | 2026-05-31 | high | 🔵 | Periodically re-verify the documented standards against live official docs (these ecosystems change fast). |
| K-002 | 2026-05-31 | medium | 🔵 | Add a worked "port an agent across tools" reference example (Claude subagent ↔ OpenCode agent ↔ Kiro steering). |
| K-003 | 2026-05-31 | low | 🔵 | Track additional agentic tools as they mature (e.g. Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI) where they share the open AGENTS.md / Agent Skills standards. |

### K-001 — Re-verify standards against live docs
- **Status:** 🔵 proposed
- **Priority:** high
- **Rationale:** Frontmatter fields, directory paths, and inclusion modes for Claude Code, Kiro, and OpenCode shift between releases. Stale specifics would make Cobb produce broken artifacts.
- **Proposed change:** On a cadence (or whenever a user reports a mismatch), fetch kiro.dev/docs, opencode.ai/docs, code.claude.com/docs, platform.claude.com/docs and reconcile the "Standards you know cold" section. Log diffs in history.md.
- **Notes:** Baseline verified 2026-05-31 at creation.

### K-002 — Worked cross-tool porting example
- **Status:** 🔵 proposed
- **Priority:** medium
- **Rationale:** Porting between tools is a common request; a canonical example would make answers faster and more consistent.
- **Proposed change:** Add a reference walkthrough mapping a Claude Code subagent's frontmatter/body to an OpenCode markdown agent and to Kiro steering, noting what each tool drops or renames.
- **Notes:** Could live as a skill rather than bloat the agent prompt.

### K-003 — Broaden tool coverage
- **Status:** 🔵 proposed
- **Priority:** low
- **Rationale:** The open AGENTS.md and Agent Skills standards are adopted by more tools than the core three.
- **Proposed change:** Add concise coverage of Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot where they intersect the open standards, clearly flagged as secondary.
- **Notes:** Keep the big-three depth primary; don't dilute.

## Parking lot / ideas
- Consider a lightweight self-review checklist Cobb runs before delivering any agent artifact (frontmatter valid, description routing-friendly, right mechanism chosen).
- Maintain a small catalog of agents/skills Cobb has authored, cross-linking their kaizen files.
