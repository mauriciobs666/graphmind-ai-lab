# Kaizen — Change History: coder

> Dated log of actual changes to the `coder` agent. Most recent first.

## 2026-07-09 — Subagent-awareness on the two "ask" spots (teco interface review follow-up)
- **What:** Step 2 (baseline) "ask before installing or mutating the environment" and the "Ask before destructive or environment-changing actions" guardrail now both say what to do when running as a subagent (e.g. delegated by `teco`): return the blocker / request as the result instead of trying to ask mid-run — subagents can't ask. Catalog entry (`claude/AGENTS.md`) updated.
- **Why:** Sweep after the 2026-07-09 teco interface review found the "ask" phrasing assumed an interactive session across several delegates (same fix applied to tdd-engineer, qa-engineer, graph-dba the same day; architect already handled it via questions-as-deliverable).
- **Plan items:** none (out-of-band, driven by teco's 2026-07-09 review).

## 2026-07-08 — Architect handoff arrives as a plan-document path
- **What:** Step 1 (Orient) updated: an `architect` handoff is now a plan **document** at `<component>/docs/plans/<slug>.md` — the coder gets the path in its brief, reads the file itself, and treats it as source of truth (gaps filled by reading code, not guessing). Synced with the architect's same-day change making the plan doc its default deliverable and teco's switch to path-based handoff.
- **Why:** The previous flow had the orchestrator paste the plan into the brief — lossy and unreviewable. Reading the artifact directly makes the handoff lossless regardless of who invokes the coder.
- **Plan items:** advances K-002 (transport fixed; live validation run still pending).

## 2026-06-20 — Dropped "senior" framing
- **What:** Removed "senior" from the `description` ("Senior software engineer" → "Software engineer") and the body opener ("You are a senior software engineer who builds" → "You are a software engineer who builds"). Mirrored in the catalog entries (`claude/README.md`, `claude/CLAUDE.md`, root `AGENTS.md`).
- **Why:** User raised the overconfidence concern with seniority framing; persona-prompting evidence (e.g. Zheng et al. 2024) shows role labels are weak-to-neutral for correctness while authority framing can hurt calibration. Quality is carried by the concrete process + guardrails ("don't fake green," "report only what you ran"), not the title. Chose the most conservative option (drop the word). Goes further than the 2026-06-05 precedent that kept "Senior" as an altitude signal — architect/coder now differ from the rest of the collection until harmonized (flagged to user).
- **Plan items:** —

## 2026-06-20 — Created
- **What:** Created the `coder` subagent (`coder/coder.md`, `model: opus`). Senior implementer that executes an approved plan/spec end-to-end: orients on the plan + code, establishes a green baseline (with explicit handling for already-red and can't-run-here cases), implements in small reversible increments, tests alongside, refactors under green, and reports only results it actually ran. Inherits all tools (no `tools` key), following the `tdd-engineer` K-003 precedent of keeping the implementer flexible.
- **Why:** User asked for two complementary Claude Code subagents, "the architect" and "the coder," with an architect→coder handoff. The `coder` is the implementation half.
- **Plan items:** seeded K-001..K-002.

## Decisions recorded at creation
- **Distinction from `tdd-engineer`:** both implement, but `tdd-engineer` is *strictly* test-first (red→green→refactor as the defining discipline). `coder` is plan-driven and pragmatic: it tests behavior thoroughly and never ships untested code, but doesn't mandate writing the failing test first unless the project requires it. The `description` explicitly routes strict-TDD requests to `tdd-engineer` so auto-delegation doesn't collide. Revisit if the two over-trigger on the same prompts.
- **Why inherit all tools:** an implementer needs Read/Write/Edit/Bash plus the ability to fetch docs and delegate; mirrors the deliberate `tdd-engineer` choice (K-003 there). Revisit only if broad access causes surprise.
