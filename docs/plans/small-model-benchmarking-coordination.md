# Small-LLM benchmarking tool (`model-bench/`) — coordination

> **Status:** active · **Owner:** `teco` · **Tracks:** — (M<n> TBD)

Coordinates delivery of [`small-model-benchmarking.md`](./small-model-benchmarking.md) (v1.1,
`architect`) against [`../requirements/small-model-benchmarking.md`](../requirements/small-model-benchmarking.md)
(Ready for design, `tico`), with statistics owned by
[`small-model-benchmarking-ml.md`](./small-model-benchmarking-ml.md) (v1.1, `data-scientist`).

## Scope of this coordination

Stakeholder decisions, 2026-09-02:

1. **Plan gate first**, with S0 dispatched in parallel (disjoint files). The plan had never been
   independently reviewed — no `docs/reviews/small-model-benchmarking.md` existed at kickoff.
2. **Drive through S3** (first real end-to-end run against a live model), then check back. S4–S8
   are out of scope for this pass and are not queued below.

## Environment notes at dispatch

- **CPG `cpg_falkorchat` is stale.** Built 2026-09-02T12:38:21Z at `4bb96e1` with
  `SOURCE_DIRTY = true`; three commits have landed on `falkor-chat/server` since (`b4cbdc7`,
  `5a5a257`, `673342b`) plus uncommitted working-tree changes. Structural answers from it must be
  confirmed against the files. No CPG exists for `model-bench/` (new component).
- **A separate coordination is open in this tree** (`salesperson-ui`), with uncommitted changes to
  `docs/plans/salesperson-ui*.md`, `docs/reviews/salesperson-ui*.md` and
  `falkor-chat/server/falkorchat/config.py`. No unit here may stage, commit, revert or otherwise
  touch those paths.

## Ledger

| Unit | Owner | Agent id | Status | Deliverable | Gate → verdict | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| U1 — Plan gate: review plan v1.1 + `-ml` note against the requirements | `analyst` | `a0e3b74e34e1d4c40` | delivered | `docs/reviews/small-model-benchmarking.md` — **needs changes**: 3 blockers, 11 majors, 8 minors, 3 nits | — (is the gate) | 174k tok / 33 tools |
| U2 — S0 component skeleton | `coder` | `aa5b28bd14869593c` | accepted | `model-bench/**` (15 files), root `AGENTS.md` (+8 lines) | teco-verified — see note | 113k tok / 30 tools |
| U3a — Revise the method note for B-1/M-1 + the new sampling design | `data-scientist` | `a394671cfc28bef87` | in-flight | `docs/plans/small-model-benchmarking-ml.md` v1.2 | `analyst` re-gate (Pass 2) → — | — |
| U3b — Fold U1's findings + U2's S0 defects + the three decisions into the plan | `architect` | `a3e258f27b83e764d` | delivered | `docs/plans/small-model-benchmarking.md` **v1.2** — 3 blockers + 13 majors + 8 minors + 4 nits all dispositioned | `analyst` re-gate (Pass 2) → — | 184k tok / 40 tools |
| U3c — FR-22a's illustrative clause cites the superseded 4×4 sampling | `tico` | — | queued | `docs/requirements/small-model-benchmarking.md` | folded into the Pass 2 re-gate | — |
| U4 — S1 core (fingerprint, results, stats, report; no model calls) | `tdd-engineer` | — | queued (after U3) | `modelbench/{fingerprint,results,stats,report,roles,cli}.py` + tests 1–6 | `analyst` + `data-scientist` (stats) → — | — |
| U5 — S2 packs, LM Studio adapter, host info, convo, tooling, runner | `coder` | — | queued (after U4) | `modelbench/{packs,lmstudio,hostinfo,convo,tooling,runner}.py` + tests 7b–12 | `analyst` → — | — |
| U6 — S3 `embedder` pack + `refresh_golden.py`, first live run | `coder` | — | queued (after U5) | `packs/embedder/**`, `scripts/refresh_golden.py`, one stored `RunResult` | `analyst` → — | — |

Unit sizing for U5 is provisional: S2 creates six modules, which is at the split boundary. It is
re-drawn against U4's actual delivery before dispatch.

## Documentation impact scan

| Document | Impact | Owner of the update |
|---|---|---|
| Root `AGENTS.md` | New `model-bench/` bullet in **Structure** + row in **Component docs** | U2 (`coder`), in the same change |
| `model-bench/README.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Created by U2; README states the three non-features (no CI, no gate, no leaderboard) | U2 |
| `model-bench/docs/{BACKLOG.md,HISTORY.md}` | Created by U2; `HISTORY.md` takes an entry per delivered stage | each implementing unit |
| `docs/HISTORY.md` (repo root) | Entry when the coordination closes | teco, at close |
| `docs/requirements/small-model-benchmarking.md` | Stays where it is (its own footnote says so) — no move | — |
| `docs/BACKLOG.md` (repo root) | Carries FR-21a's deferred judged-reply-quality layer as an open item (plan R-4) | S8 — out of this pass's scope, flagged |

## Decisions and events

- **2026-09-02 — kickoff.** Plan read; §7 declares ready to implement, with one verify-during-
  implementation item (R-1: whether `lms ps --json` exposes the KV-cache setting on a loaded model,
  checked during S2/U5). No stakeholder answer is outstanding on the plan itself.

- **2026-09-02 — U1 delivered, verdict `needs changes`.** All three blockers land inside S1–S3, this
  pass's scope, and none is a disagreement with the design — each is a guarantee the plan *states*
  with no mechanism behind it. B-1: the tool-caller instrument ignores clustering, so
  `min_detectable_difference` and `verdict()` are anti-conservative against `-ml` §7.2/R1. B-2: the
  §3.1 metric-agreement cross-check is not constructible (the ranked lists it needs are not an
  artifact), and it is the *only* mitigation behind D1, the plan's central decision. B-3: the BM25
  reference arm has no result-schema representation, so `store()`'s own no-bypass fingerprint rule
  rejects it — decided in S1, surfaced in S3.
- **2026-09-02 — mid-run correction relayed to U2 while in flight.** U1's finding m1 (S0's
  done-condition is unsatisfiable: pytest 9.1.1 exits 5 on zero collection) was `SendMessage`d to
  the running `coder` rather than held. It landed: S0 ships one real test
  (`tests/test_package.py`, version-vs-distribution-metadata) instead of configuring the exit code
  away, and `model-bench/AGENTS.md` records *why* that route was refused.
  **Caveat worth carrying:** the agent's returned summary still asserted "no placeholder test (the
  brief forbids one)" — prose that predated the correction it had already applied. The tree, not
  the report, was the state of record; teco verified against the tree.
- **2026-09-02 — U2 accepted.** `./setup.sh && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` → `1 passed`, exit 0;
  `ruff check .` clean; both re-run by teco, not taken on report. Note the done-condition only holds
  with `model-bench/` as the working directory — from the repo root there is no root
  `pyproject.toml`, so `rootdir` becomes the monorepo and collection walks into `mcp-monitor/tests`
  (measured: 8 collection errors, exit 2). That belongs in the plan; it is folded into U3.
- **Follow-up, out of scope, not chased:** root `AGENTS.md` was already past its own ~2 500-word
  smell threshold before this coordination (2 729 words at `HEAD`, 2 823 after U2's two required
  insertions). A bloat sweep is overdue and is nobody's unit here.

- **2026-09-02 — three stakeholder decisions taken, closing the gate's open questions.**
  (1) **Tool-caller sampling → 12 distinct scripts × 1 run, temperature 0**, replacing 4 × 4
  replicates; same run budget, authoring cost lands in S6. Taken on `-ml` §4.5's own argument.
  (2) **`guard-judge` gets no `primaryMetric`** — both class-conditional rates, equal weight, no
  headline number; the stakeholder declined to rank false-advance against false-suspend. Design
  consequence flagged to the `architect`: a pack *without* a primary metric must become a
  first-class case in the manifest schema and `report.py`, which today assume one always exists.
  (3) **The S3 self-check is a diagnostic, never a gate** — below-baseline does not block S3; the
  deviation and its investigation go in the test report.
- **2026-09-02 — U3 split into two file-disjoint parallel units.** B-1 and M-1 are statistics
  findings owned by the method note, not the plan, so `data-scientist` revises the note while
  `architect` revises the plan. The `architect`'s brief forbids restating the note's formulas or
  pinning `stats.py`'s clustering signatures — the gate found silent divergence between the two
  documents, and collapsing to one source of truth is the fix.
- **2026-09-02 — a second, unrelated session is committing to this repository concurrently**
  (the `salesperson-ui` / `falkor-chat` storefront coordination; commits `acb5a2a`, `0efc014`,
  `2f7938d`, `1951d94` landed mid-run). Every brief in this coordination is fenced to its one
  file, and teco verified both integration commits touched only their own units' paths.

- **2026-09-02 — U3b delivered, plan v1.2.** Every blocker fixed rather than declined. Two are worth
  recording because they changed the design rather than patching text. **B-2:** the metric-agreement
  cross-check is rebuilt as a hand-transcribed `metrics_agreement.json` (20 cases, with
  `sourceGitSha`/`sourceSha256`), transcribed manually *because* only 6 of the 20 live in
  `parametrize` tables — a mechanical extractor would capture a third of them and pass. The
  `architect` states the honest residual: this is weaker than v1.1 claimed, and D1 is re-argued on
  what actually carries it. **B-3:** `armKind ∈ {model, deterministic}` with both a required-field
  *and* a forbidden-field map — the forbid half is what makes a BM25 arm declaring
  `modelKey: "bm25"` fail loudly instead of silently passing the fingerprint rule.
- **Decision 2 built as first-class, not special-cased:** `verdictMetrics` (the pre-registered
  family) plus an **explicit** `primaryMetric` that may be `null`; `validate_pack` rejects an
  *omitted* key, and `report.py` has no code path that synthesises a headline from the family.
- **One nit withdrawn rather than fixed** (m7): the gate's proposed `ruff` mechanism was found not
  constructible, and was replaced by `validate_pack`'s AST walk plus `run` failing closed. Recorded
  because a declined finding that is silently dropped is the failure mode the disposition table exists
  to prevent.
