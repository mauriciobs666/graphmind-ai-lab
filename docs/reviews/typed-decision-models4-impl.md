# Typed Decision Models, Plan 4 — Implementation Review

> **Status:** active · **Owner:** `analyst` · **Tracks:** —

## Pass 1 — U5.1 scaffold (2026-10-31)

### Scope & verdict

**Reviewed:** the untracked `decision-models/` tree (`pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `setup.sh`, `decisionmodels/__init__.py`, `tests/test_fr8_isolation.py`,
`tests/test_package.py`, `docs/HISTORY.md`) and the two added root `AGENTS.md` lines. **Baseline:**
`docs/plans/typed-decision-models4.md` v1.2 §3.1 and §4.1 (U5.1 row), v1.3
`docs/plans/typed-decision-models.md` §3.4 and §3.2.2, `docs/plans/typed-decision-models2.md`
§3.5, `docs/plans/typed-decision-models3.md` §2 (decision-models cannot import model-bench), and
FR-8/AC-7 in `docs/requirements/typed-decision-models.md`. Later units (U5.2 onwards) are out of
scope except where U5.1's text makes claims about them.

**Verdict: approve with suggestions.** The done-condition holds. I ran the suite from
`decision-models/`: `.venv/bin/pytest -q` gives 20 passed, `ruff check .` is clean and `bash -n setup.sh`
passes. Planting `import redis` in `decisionmodels/__init__.py` reddens
`test_decisionmodels_reaches_only_stdlib_and_itself`. No blocker and no major. The findings are about
pinning the check (F1), stating its limits accurately (F2, F3), and one design boundary that is the
architect's call (F4).

CPG: considered, not relevant — no `cpg_decisionmodels` graph is loaded (`GRAPHS`: only `cpg_falkorchat`); the component is new and untracked, with two source files read in full.

**Method.** I used a fresh `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` and `-p no:cacheprovider` for every run. Each
mutation was made against a copy kept aside in the scratchpad, then restored and checked equal with
`cmp`. No git command changed the tree. The final suite run after all mutations gave 20 passed.

### Findings

**F1 — minor — three forbidden fragments are unpinned; deleting any one leaves the suite green.**
*Owner: `coder`.* Verified by mutation: removing `"falkorchat"` (M1), `"falkor_chat"` (M2) or
`"falkordb"` (M3) from `FORBIDDEN_FRAGMENTS` (`tests/test_fr8_isolation.py:35-42`) gives 20 passed
each time. Every planted case that mentions these names is an *import*, which the allowlist refuses,
and the case's `expected` substring (`'falkordb'`) matches the allowlist message too. Removing
`"falkor-chat"`, `"redis"` or `6379` does redden (M4–M6). This matters because, without M3, a string
reach such as `subprocess.run(["docker", "exec", "falkordb-dev", ...])` (E3b, red today) would pass.
**Fix:** add one planted case per fragment that refuses it as a *string literal*. Examples:
`"falkordb-dev"` in a `subprocess` argv, `Path("falkor_chat")`, and `"falkorchat.app"` as a string.
Assert the `string literal reaches '<fragment>'` message, not just the bare name. Then re-run M1–M3
and confirm each goes red.

**F2 — minor — the test's docstring overclaims the dynamic-import coverage, and the README says
"enforces".** *Owner: `coder`.* `tests/test_fr8_isolation.py:9-10` says `__import__`/`import_module`
calls count as imports, and a non-literal name is refused. Three evasions of the dynamic-import
detection stayed green, verified by planting each in `decisionmodels/__init__.py`: the aliased form
`from importlib import import_module as im; im("modelbench")` (E5), `getattr(importlib,
"import_module")("modelbench")` (E6), and `vars(builtins)["__import__"]("modelbench")` (E6b). The
full table of 16 planted evasions, 8 green, is in the Appendix. The docstring's closing caveat (run-time assembly is not seen) is honest,
but neither `README.md:21-23` ("enforces that") nor the `AGENTS.md` invariant states the residual.
**Judgement:** the residual is acceptable for a static tripwire. FR-8's realistic failure is an
implementer reaching a real path or database by habit, which almost always uses a literal. Two more
layers stand behind it: AC-7 is checked on items (`origin: "synthetic"` plus the generator hash,
v1.3 §3.4), and U5.7's `guard_hook.py` confines the labelling session's reads. **Fix:** (a) make
the docstring exact: literal-named `__import__`/`import_module` calls by bare name or attribute, with
aliases, `getattr`, `exec`, `runpy`, bytes and assembled strings or ports not seen. (b) Change
README "enforces" to "is a static tripwire for". (c) Add one clause to the `AGENTS.md` FR-8 bullet
citing the docstring for what the check cannot see. Optional, cheap hardening, which I prototyped
on a scratch copy: scan `bytes` constants (decode as latin-1), and add the `asname` of an
`ImportFrom` of `import_module`/`__import__` to the call names. With those, E5 and E7 go red and the
14 planted cases plus the negative control stay green. Each needs its own planted case.

**F3 — minor — `AGENTS.md` misstates the boundary: the shingle script is not "the one sanctioned
reader of model-bench data".** *Owner: `coder`.* `decision-models/AGENTS.md:22-23`. v1.3 §3.2.2 gives
decision-models a guarded equality test. That test byte-compares its contract copies against
`model-bench/tests/fixtures/decision-contract/`, so it reads model-bench data (U5.2). Plan2 §3.5's
rule is narrower: only the script reads the **side-check items**. This was verified against the plan
text. As written, the invariant will be false the moment U5.2 lands, and a context file is where a
false invariant hurts most. **Fix:** change "the one sanctioned reader of model-bench data" to
"the one sanctioned reader of the side-check items
(`model-bench/packs/guard-judge-understanding/`)".

**F4 — minor — `scripts/` and `agents/*.py` are entirely outside FR-8's check.** *Owner:
`architect`, via `teco`.* The implementer is conformant: plan2 §3.5 says "the FR-8 test still scans
`decisionmodels/` only". Excluding the script from the *side-check fragment* is necessary, because
it must name `guard-judge-understanding`. But excluding whole directories also removes the import
allowlist and the falkor-chat, FalkorDB and Redis fragments from every future script and from
`agents/guard_hook.py`, which runs inside the labelling session. A second script that reads a real
falkor-chat thread into `data/` would then be guarded only by the `AGENTS.md` prose. **Suggestion
(a design decision, not prototyped):** scan `scripts/` and `agents/` with the same checker plus a
per-file exemption map, `{"scripts/import_side_check_shingles.py": {"guard-judge-understanding"}}`.
Two planted cases go with it: that script naming `falkor-chat` reddens, and a *different* script
naming the side-check slug reddens. The natural unit is U5.10, when the script lands. This is not a
U5.1 blocker.

**F5 — nit — the bare `redis` substring false-positives on ordinary words.** *Owner: `coder`.*
Verified: planting `("predisposition", "redistribuir")` reddens the real-package test (E15). U5.3's
pt-BR seed axes and rubrics are plausible sources of such words. The `AGENTS.md` rule "never widen
either to make a unit green" would then turn a non-reach into a plan-change escalation. **Fix:**
match `(?<![a-z])redis(?![a-z])` on the lower-cased literal. I checked it: it hits `redis://`,
`redis-cli`, `redis_url`, `REDIS_HOST` and `falkordb-redis`, and misses `predisposition` and
`redistribuir`. The trade-off is that it misses `myredis`. Add `"predisposition"` to the negative
control.

**F6 — nit — the root `AGENTS.md` bullet's "(FR-8)" has no referent at root.** *Owner: `coder`.*
In an always-loaded root file, "FR-8" does not say which requirements document is meant. Write
"(synthetic inputs only)", or drop it, because the Component-docs row already cites
`docs/requirements/typed-decision-models.md`. Otherwise both lines are one line each (101 and 171
characters), and the row matches model-bench's shape.

**Judgement calls (asked by the caller):**
1. *Scan `decisionmodels/` only:* **accept.** This is conformant to plan2 §3.5. The wider boundary
   is F4's architect question.
2. *Docstrings exempt:* **accept.** Module docs must be able to describe FR-8. The exemption is
   pinned: removing it reddens the negative control (M7). Its only evasion is reading `__doc__` back
   as data (E8), which is contrived.
3. *A forbidden list wider than v1.3's literal:* **accept.** v1.3 §3.4 already names `falkordb` and
   `redis`. The side-check slug implements plan2 §3.5's "must never read the 85 items", and refusing
   `modelbench` implements plan3 §2. Allowing the text "model-bench" is right: decision-models
   legitimately names model-bench's contract fixtures. The list's pinning gaps and its one false
   positive are F1 and F5.
4. *`pythonpath = ["."]` and reading the version from `pyproject.toml`:* **accept.** Both checks
   can fail. Bumping `__version__` to `0.1.1` reddens `test_version_matches_pyproject`, and adding
   `dependencies = ["requests"]` reddens `test_no_runtime_dependencies`; both are verified. Reading
   `pyproject.toml` also avoids editable-install metadata, which goes stale until reinstall
   (inferred, not run).
5. *No `BACKLOG.md`, `labeler.py` or `live` marker:* **accept.** Root `AGENTS.md` says modules
   adopt `BACKLOG.md` "when first needed". `labeler.py` is void under plan4 §1 and §3.1. No live
   test exists yet, so a marker would select nothing. There is one carry-forward for `teco`'s
   ledger: the first unit that adds a network or LM Studio test must add model-bench's
   `-m "not live"` `addopts`. `AGENTS.md:33` already promises a network-free default suite.

**(d) `docs/HISTORY.md`.** The entry is accurate. I counted 14 planted cases plus a negative control,
and 3 + 14 + 1 + 2 = 20 tests, which matches the 20 passed I ran. The pins are model-bench's: the
`pytest`/`ruff` ranges and the ruff select are identical in `model-bench/pyproject.toml`. "`setup.sh`
(model-bench's, renamed)" is true, verified by a name-normalized diff: only two comment lines differ.
The format follows model-bench's `**What:**`/`**Verified:**` style. I could not re-observe the
implementer's six `__init__.py` mutants as runs, but I reproduced the `import redis` one (C1). The
entry needs no change for this pass. If F1, F2, F3 or F5 is fixed in U5.1, add one line to the same
entry rather than a new one.

### What's solid

- The AST walk covers imports inside functions, `from` imports, relative imports and literal
  dynamic imports. A non-literal `import_module(name)` is refused, which is pinned (M8). Allowing
  relative imports is pinned too (M9).
- `test_the_scan_sees_the_real_package` prevents a vacuous green from a renamed package.
- The planted cases run in a scratch package under `tmp_path`, so the checker is tested without
  touching the real tree. The negative control exercises both the docstring exemption and allowed
  stdlib network modules.
- `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` state the present tense with no history: 268 and 263 words, no line
  over 700 characters. Work status is limited to one "Scaffold only" line in each, which the next
  unit rewrites.
- `.venv`, `*.egg-info`, `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` are all ignored. `git status
  --untracked-files=all` lists only the nine authored files.

### Open questions

- F4: should FR-8's static check extend to `scripts/` and `agents/` with per-file exemptions, in
  U5.10? This is the architect's call, because it amends plan2 §3.5's "scans `decisionmodels/` only".

### Appendix — evasion and checker mutants

Evasions were planted by appending to `decisionmodels/__init__.py`. I ran
`test_decisionmodels_reaches_only_stdlib_and_itself`, then restored the file and confirmed it with
`cmp`. **Green** means the evasion is unseen.

| ID | Planted | Result |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `import redis` (positive control) | red |
| E1 | `"red" + "is"` | green |
| E2 | `os.path.join(os.environ.get("REPO", ".."), "falkor" + "-chat", "server")` | green |
| E3 | `subprocess.run([..., "redis" "-cli"])` (implicit concatenation, joined at parse time) | red |
| E3b | `subprocess.run(["docker", "exec", "falkordb-dev", "true"])` | red |
| E4 | `socket.create_connection(("localhost", "6379"))` (string port) | green |
| E4b | `socket.create_connection(("localhost", 6000 + 379))` | green |
| E4c | `socket.create_connection(("localhost", 6380))` | green |
| E5 | `from importlib import import_module as im; im("modelbench")` | green |
| E6 | `getattr(importlib, "import_module")("modelbench")` | green |
| E6b | `vars(builtins)["__import__"]("modelbench")` | green |
| E7 | `b"...redis"` bytes literal | green |
| E8 | a function docstring `"redis://localhost:6379"` read back via `__doc__` | green |
| E9 | `runpy.run_path("../model-bench/modelbench/packs.py")` | green |
| E10 | `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mb", "../model-bench/...")` | green |
| E11 | `sys.path.insert(0, "../falkor-chat/server")` | red |
| E12 | `Path("..").glob("model-bench/packs/guard-judge-*/items.jsonl")` | green |
| E13 | `sys.path` + `import_module("modelbench")` (literal) | red |
| E14 | `exec("import modelbench")` | green |
| E15 | `("predisposition", "redistribuir")` (false-positive probe) | red |

Checker mutants were applied to `tests/test_fr8_isolation.py`. I ran the full suite, then restored
the file and confirmed it with `cmp`.

| ID | Mutation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | drop `"falkorchat"` fragment | 20 passed (unpinned, F1) |
| M2 | drop `"falkor_chat"` fragment | 20 passed (unpinned, F1) |
| M3 | drop `"falkordb"` fragment | 20 passed (unpinned, F1) |
| M4 | drop `"falkor-chat"` fragment | 1 failed |
| M5 | drop `"redis"` fragment | 2 failed |
| M6 | `FORBIDDEN_INTS = frozenset()` | 1 failed |
| M7 | no docstring exemption | 2 failed |
| M8 | non-literal dynamic import not reported | 1 failed |
| M9 | absolute `from` imports skipped | 2 failed |
| M10 | treat `bool` as int | 20 passed (equivalent mutant: `True != 6379`) |

## Pass 2 — U5.2 guard contract copies (2026-10-31)

### Scope & verdict

**Reviewed:** the uncommitted work on top of `9ccc2518`, all in `decision-models/`:
- `decisionmodels/render.py` and `decisionmodels/hashing.py`;
- the byte-copies `tests/fixtures/decision-contract/render-guard.jsonl` (14 rows) and
  `input-hash.jsonl` (4 rows);
- `tests/test_decision_contract.py`;
- the edits to `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and `docs/HISTORY.md`.

**Against:**
- plan4 §4.1's U5.2 row (done when the copies are `cmp`-equal and every row passes);
- v1.3 §3.2, §3.2.1, §3.2.2 and §3.5;
- plan4 §3.2, the request writer that consumes `render.py`.

**Truth sources, read in full for the functions concerned:**
- falkor-chat's real `app._render_judge_user` (`falkor-chat/server/falkorchat/app.py:695-730`)
  and `guards._recent_turns` (`guards.py:538-570`);
- model-bench's transcriptions `_normalize_turns` and `_render_judge_user`
  (`model-bench/modelbench/scoring/classification.py:29-82`);
- model-bench's `input_hash` (`model-bench/modelbench/decisions.py:54-56`, `:168-183`).

**Verdict: approve with suggestions.** The done-condition holds, and I verified each part:
- Both copies are `cmp`-equal to model-bench's.
- `.venv/bin/pytest -q` gives 53 passed, and `ruff check .` is clean.
- A three-way differential agrees on every generated input. It ran over 12,000 generated
  cases plus 720 boundary cases, with no mismatch for normalization, rendering or the composed item
  rendering (Appendix B).

There are no blockers and no majors.

`render.py`'s md5 is `2ce93c54…`. That file is behaviorally sound on the contract's domain: it
matches falkor-chat's real function on every differential case and every vector row. So no
behavior-changing residue from the implementer's failed restore remains. A behavior-neutral residue
would be invisible to this check, but the file reads clean line by line.

CPG: considered, not relevant — no `cpg_decisionmodels` graph is loaded; the two modules (135 lines) and every truth-source function were read in full.

**Method.** I used a fresh `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` and `-p no:cacheprovider`. Each mutation was made
against a copy kept aside, then restored and checked equal with `cmp`. At the end I compared the
sha256 of every file under `decisionmodels/` and `tests/` against a baseline taken before the first
mutation: all 8 were unchanged. No git command changed the tree. The final suite run gave 53 passed.

### Findings

**P2-F1 — minor — `render_guard_item`'s turn order is unpinned. Reversing it leaves 53 green.**
*Owner: `coder`.* Verified with mutant R18: `normalize_turns(...)[::-1]` in `render.py:88` gives 53
passed. The vector rows exercise `render_guard_input` over already-normalized `recentTurns`. The
two `render_guard_item` tests use one turn and zero turns. But `render_guard_item` is the function
plan4 §3.2's request writer calls to produce the text the labeller votes on. An order or wiring
slip there would silently change the labelled inputs while every vector stays green.
**Fix:** add one `render_guard_item` test with at least 8 raw rows. Include an invalid row, a speaker
fallback, and a newest turn long enough to force the cap to drop a turn. Write the expected string
by hand from v1.3 §3.2's rule, oldest first. Then confirm R18 goes red.

**P2-F2 — minor — the `HISTORY.md` "Verified" line is not accurate as written.** *Owner: `coder`.*
`docs/HISTORY.md` says "every file was restored `cmp`-equal". By the implementer's own report to
`teco`, one run left two mutants in `render.py`, and they were removed afterwards. The mutant table
is also not reproducible as stated: it lists "the cap check's separator arithmetic", but this
implementation has no separator arithmetic, because it searches directly (judgement call 3).
`HISTORY.md` is the record, so a false line there misleads. **Fix:** replace the mutant sentence with
one present-tense line. It should say that the mutants were re-run after the failed restore was
recovered (md5 `2ce93c54…`), and cite this pass for the independent re-sample. Do not
narrate the incident.

**P2-F3 — minor — turn normalization has no cross-component pin. This answers judgement call 1.**
*Owner: `architect`, via `teco`. The vector would be built by a model-bench `coder` unit.* The rule
is shared by falkor-chat (`guards._recent_turns`, the truth), model-bench (`_normalize_turns`) and
now decision-models. v1.3 §3.2.1 also makes it the join-in renderer's rule. But v1.3 §3.2.2's
vector families do not include it. In this component, the four hand-written tests do pin the rule
as written: my mutants R9, R10, R11, R13, R14 and R15 all go red, and so do the coordinator's two.
Today all three copies agree: 0 mismatches in 12,000 differential cases. What a hand test cannot
catch is drift *at the truth source*, for example falkor-chat changing `RECENT_TURNS_N`. Through
plan4 §3.2, such drift would silently make the labeller see different evidence from what
falkor-chat's judge sees at run time. **Suggestion:** add a model-bench-owned
`normalize-turns.jsonl`, with expected outputs produced by running falkor-chat's real
`_recent_turns` (as `render-guard.jsonl` is produced). Byte-copy it here, and fold it into U5.2b
or U4, which needs the rule anyway for join-in. Until then the hand tests are adequate for a
contract that matches today. This is not a U5.2 blocker.

**P2-F4 — nit — `AGENTS.md` grew 282 → 362 words, partly by restating `HISTORY.md`.** *Owner:
`coder`.* "Current state" was rewritten rather than appended to, which is right. But it opens with
"Landed: …" and then says what landed is in `HISTORY.md`. It will grow again with every U5.x unit.
The new "Contract copies are byte-copies" invariant is genuine new scope and should stay. Its
clause "pins row counts to the file's non-blank lines" is test detail that belongs in the test's
docstring. **Fix:** make "Current state" one sentence naming the modules present
(`render.py`, `hashing.py`, guard only), cite `HISTORY.md` for the rest, and drop the row-count
clause.

**Judgement calls:**
1. *Normalization in `render.py`, pinned only by hand tests:* the pin is adequate for U5.2, but a
   vector should pin it later. See P2-F3; ownership is the architect's call, with the vector
   produced in model-bench.
2. *`INPUT_FIELDS_BY_ROLE` is `guard-judge` only:* **accept.** It equals model-bench's mapping today
   (`dict(...) ==` checked), and model-bench itself has only that row until U4. An unknown role
   raises `ValueError`, which is tested. `input_hash` matches model-bench's on 20,000 random nested
   items, with 0 mismatches. Mutants H1–H7 all go red.
3. *A direct newest-k search instead of the separator arithmetic:* **accept.** No divergence was
   found:
   - It matches falkor-chat's real function and model-bench's port on 12,000 random cases, about
     3,400 of which render within 100 characters of the cap.
   - It also matches on 720 boundary cases, and at the exact edge: a single turn whose message is
     exactly 6,000 characters is kept, and one character more falls back to the base.
   - The differential has power: the positive controls `MAX_CHARS` 5999 and 6001 each produce 453
     mismatches in 1,500 cases.

   Its cost is quadratic in turn count, which falkor-chat removed in its K-027 n-2 change. That is
   irrelevant behind the 6-turn normalization.
4. *README Status rewritten:* **accept.** It was replaced in place and is in the present tense. It
   tracks work status, so `teco` lists it at milestone close (root `AGENTS.md`, compaction bullet).

**FR-8:** this holds, and it is verified. `render.py` imports only `json`, `collections.abc` and
`typing`; `hashing.py` imports only `hashlib`, `json`, `collections.abc`, `types` and `typing`.
`tests/test_fr8_isolation.py` gives 24 passed with both new modules in its scan. "falkor-chat"
appears only in module docstrings, which are exempt. The model-bench path (`_MODEL_BENCH`) lives
only in `tests/test_decision_contract.py`.

**Growth-stops:** root `AGENTS.md`'s growth-stops bullet covers requirements, plans and reviews, not
these files. I checked them against their own rules instead:
- `AGENTS.md` follows the context-file rule (rewrite, do not append); see P2-F4.
- `HISTORY.md` is read by lookup, so appending one entry is correct; see P2-F2 for accuracy.

### What's solid

- The guarded equality test reads both files as bytes. The row-count test counts from raw bytes
  rather than through the loader. A one-byte fixture change goes red (F1).
- Most of my re-sample went red (Appendix A): 24 of 26 mutants. That includes every
  canonicalisation step of the hash and every block, separator and cap edge of the renderer.
  Of the 2 survivors, R18 is P2-F1's gap and R12 is equivalent on this domain.
- R12 deserves a note: dropping `default=str` survives because JSON-loaded items carry only
  JSON-native values. It would matter only for an in-memory `understanding` holding, say, a
  `datetime`, and no current caller passes one.
- A non-Mapping turn row raises `AttributeError` here, exactly as in model-bench, whereas
  falkor-chat skips it. That is consistent with the evaluation side and loud. U5.4's schema check
  is the right place to refuse such an item.

### Appendix A — re-sampled mutants (Pass 2)

Each mutant was a single replacement, followed by the full suite. Mutants whose target text also
appears in a docstring were re-applied to the code occurrence; the first attempt hit the docstring
and was discarded.

| ID | Mutation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `MAX_CHARS` 6000→5999 | 4 failed |
| R2 | `<= MAX_CHARS` → `<` | 2 failed |
| R3 | state block always emitted | 11 failed |
| R4 | `sort_keys=False` (state) | 3 failed |
| R5 | `indent=1` (state) | 5 failed |
| R6 | keep the oldest turns instead of the newest | 2 failed |
| R7 | no hard truncation of `base` | 2 failed |
| R8 | turns joined by `\n\n` | 4 failed |
| R9 | default speaker `Member` | 2 failed |
| R10 | slice before filtering | 1 failed |
| R11 | no `authorId` fallback | 1 failed |
| R12 | no `default=str` | **53 passed** (equivalent on JSON-loaded items) |
| R13 | empty text kept | 1 failed |
| R14 | default role `assistant` | 1 failed |
| R15 | `render_guard_item` skips normalization | 1 failed |
| R16 | header gains a trailing space | 9 failed |
| R17 | state with `ensure_ascii=False` | 1 failed |
| R18 | `render_guard_item` reverses turn order | **53 passed** (P2-F1) |
| H1 | `ensure_ascii=True` | 1 failed |
| H2 | spaced separators | 4 failed |
| H3 | `path` dropped from the fields | 4 failed |
| H4 | absent field written as `null` | 1 failed |
| H5 | `sort_keys=False` | 4 failed |
| H6 | UTF-16 encoding | 4 failed |
| H7 | `itemId` added to the fields | 4 failed |
| F1 | one byte in the `render-guard.jsonl` copy | 2 failed |

### Appendix B — differential

The differential script ran with `python -I`, against `decisionmodels.render`, model-bench's
`classification`, and falkor-chat's `_render_judge_user`/`_recent_turns`. The falkor-chat functions
were extracted from source by AST, so no falkor-chat import ran. Scratch script:
`/tmp/claude-1000/-home-mauricio-prg-graphmind-ai-lab/c6eed315-dc2c-4b2c-99e2-eece159b76c4/scratchpad/p2/diff/differential.py`.

**Generated inputs:**
- turn counts of 0–40;
- texts of 0–3,000 characters, with lengths of 399, 400 and 401 over-sampled, using non-ASCII,
  newline, quote and emoji characters;
- invalid `text` values: `None`, the empty string and an int;
- empty, `None` and `0` speaker fallbacks;
