## 1. Goal & scope

Build the M3 **run/step-run executor** for **LLM-native workflows**: a workflow node is a
plain-language system prompt the model executes as a bounded agent within an author-set toolset
fence (FR-1/FR-6); transitions are natural-language conditions an LLM judges against run context
(FR-2); the author picks per node and per edge whether it is LLM-native or deterministic, and both
coexist in one workflow (FR-3). The run is triggered by a chat `@mention` (FR-7), the nodes can post
to the thread and retrieve via GraphRAG and call tools including MCP tools (FR-5), and — when the run
is a **debug instance** — every aspect of execution is traced for after-the-fact diagnosis (FR-4).
The delivered proof is the **conversational triage flow** (intake → research → answer, AC-1…AC-6).

**In scope (this feature):**
- The `WorkflowRun`/`StepRun` executor loop over a materialized snapshot (DESIGN §6.2).
- LLM-native step execution as a bounded, tool-scoped agent loop; fuzzy (LLM-judged) transition
  guards; deterministic step/guard **dispatch seam** so the two coexist.
- Suspend/resume driven by human chat replies (the intake loop, AC-2).
- Node capabilities: post message (reuse §4 write), GraphRAG retrieve (§6), call tool, **MCP-client**
  seam (scoped — see §4), human-handoff *capability* (present, not exercised — §4).
- Trigger linkage `TRIGGERED_BY` (FR-7/AC-1) and step-emission linkage (StepRun→Message), reconciled
  with the existing `AgentResponder` @mention path.
- Per-run tracing (debug vs lean) and the audit-trail records (FR-4/AC-5).
- Runaway-loop safety: run-level step budget + per-node iteration cap (§7).
- The triage proof def + seed + end-to-end run (AC-1…AC-4).

**Explicitly out of scope (deferred, do NOT build here):**
- The **business-process (deterministic) proof flow** — deferred by the requirements. The
  deterministic step/guard *evaluators* land only as a dispatch seam with the trivial cases; a full
  expression-formula evaluator is a later slice (§3, §6).
- **Human approval / hand-off in the flow** (FR-5d) — the tool/capability is wired but the triage
  proof does not exercise it (the intake *wait-for-reply* is a distinct mechanic — §2.4).
- **External MCP servers wired into the proof flow** — the MCP-**client** lands as an interface +
  registry + a stub-server integration test; connecting a real external MCP server is deferred (§4).
- Retrieval-quality *evaluation harness* itself (that is `graphrag-eval-ml.md` / K-026); this plan
  consumes its recommendations, it does not build the harness.

**Reconciliation with the M3 slice map.** This feature, as reframed, spans what the Part-A
decomposition split across **K-022** (executor), **K-023** (chat linkage: `TRIGGERED_BY` +
StepRun→Message), and the **conversational half of K-024** (the triage proof). K-024's
business-process proof and K-025 QA remain separate downstream items. The backlog entries should be
re-annotated to reflect that the LLM-native reframe pulls the trigger + conversational proof into
this executor deliverable (a doc task, flagged in §11).

## 2. Execution model

### 2.1 The run lifecycle & states

A `WorkflowRun` (DESIGN §6.2) has `status ∈ {running, waiting, done, failed}` (a **property**, not a
label — locked §1.2; the `status` index is already provisioned). The engine loop, per DESIGN §6.2:

```
start → [AT_STEP = start step]
loop:
  execute current step (deterministic handler OR LLM-native agent loop)  → step output + outcome `on`
  record StepRun (RAN→Step, HAS_STEP_RUN, NEXT from prev)                 [single GRAPH.QUERY]
  evaluate outgoing TRANSITION guards against run ctx, in `order`         → first firing transition
    OUTCOME A — a guard fires                                            → move AT_STEP to its `to` step; continue loop [single GRAPH.QUERY]
    OUTCOME B — no guard fires AND step.config.waitsForHuman == true      → status = waiting; return (resume on human reply)
    OUTCOME C — no guard fires AND NOT waitsForHuman:
        - step has outgoing transitions → RE-EXECUTE the same step (self-loop); continue loop
                                          (bounded by the step budget — never an unbounded park)
        - step has NO outgoing transitions (terminal) → status = done; return
  enforce step budget (§7): stepCount > maxSteps → status = failed; return
```

**The three loop outcomes are exhaustive and defined for every `type:'agent'` step** (closing the
M1 gap — there is no longer any "wait/intake node" inferred from graph shape). The suspend signal is
an **explicit per-step config flag `waitsForHuman: true`** (see §2.2 schema), not an inference:

- **A (advance)** — a guard fired; relink `AT_STEP` and continue.
- **B (suspend)** — no guard fired *and* the step declares `waitsForHuman: true` (only intake does in
  the triage flow). The run parks in `waiting`, to be resumed by a human reply (§2.4). A step that
  *cannot* be unblocked by a human must **never** set this flag — otherwise it parks forever.
- **C (re-loop or terminate)** — no guard fired and the step does **not** wait for a human: if it has
  outgoing transitions it **re-executes** (a legitimate self-loop, e.g. a research node whose guard
  isn't yet satisfied gathers more and retries), bounded by the step budget (§7); if it is terminal
  (no outgoing transitions) the run is `done`. This is the case that was previously undefined — a
  non-waiting node with an unsatisfied guard now re-loops against the budget rather than parking or
  silently hanging. Per **D5**, the triage research→answer transition is **unconditional** (§2.5/§8),
  so research advances the moment it produces findings and never relies on outcome C in the proof
  flow — but the rule is stated generally so the executor is deterministic for any def.

Each write that moves state (`record StepRun` + relink `AT_STEP`) is a **single `GRAPH.QUERY`** —
the AT_STEP relink (delete old edge, create new) plus the StepRun create + NEXT append must be atomic
per the locked HEAD/TAIL-style atomicity rule (AGENTS.md rule 4). The graph-dba gate authors the
verified Cypher; §3 specifies the shapes.

### 2.2 LLM-native node execution (FR-1/FR-6) — a bounded, tool-scoped agent loop

An LLM-native node is a new step type **`type: 'agent'`** whose opaque `config` string deserializes
(app-side only — never filtered in Cypher, rule 8) to:

```jsonc
{
  "mode": "llm",
  "systemPrompt": "You are the intake agent. Ask clarifying questions until you can state the user's request precisely…",
  "tools": ["graphrag_retrieve", "post_message"],   // the author-set fence (FR-6/AC-6)
  "permissions": { "post": true, "handoff": false }, // coarse allow-flags, optional
  "waitsForHuman": true,                              // explicit suspend signal (§2.1 outcome B) — intake only
  "maxIterations": 4                                  // per-node loop cap (§7; DS default 4)
}
```

The executor runs this as an agent loop (`executor.WorkflowExecutor._run_agent_node`):

1. Build the message list: the node `systemPrompt` + assembled **context** = run `ctx` (serialized
   state carried between steps) + recent thread messages (via `services.read_thread` / a since-read
   anchored on a per-run thread cursor stored in `ctx`) so the node sees the conversation and the
   prior nodes' outputs.
2. Call the LLM with **only the node's scoped tool schemas** (built from `config.tools` — this is the
   AC-6 enforcement point: an ungranted tool is never offered and, defensively, a tool call to an
   ungranted name is rejected by the dispatcher).
3. If the LLM returns a **tool call** → dispatch via the `ToolRegistry` (§4), append the result as a
   tool message, loop (bounded by `maxIterations`).
4. If the LLM returns a **final text / an explicit outcome** → that is the step's `output` and the
   emitted `on` outcome (default `"done"`; a node may emit a named outcome the guards branch on).
5. Every LLM prompt/response, tool call/result, and the iteration count are handed to the tracer
   (§5) — recorded only for a debug instance.

This honors FR-6 ("the model decides freely — which actions, in what order — within the fence"): the
executor does not script the action order; it offers the scoped tools and lets the model drive, with
the loop cap as the only bound.

> **LLM tool-calling is a new capability of the LLM seam.** Today `llm.LLM` is
> `complete(messages) -> str` (single-shot, used by `AgentResponder`). The executor needs
> function/tool-calling: extend the seam with `chat(messages, tools) -> ChatResult` (text-or-tool-calls),
> OpenAI-shaped, on `LMStudioLLM`. **Risk/verify (§9):** small local models (the default
> `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`) are uneven at function-calling; the DS note (§10, delivered) judged this and
> recommends **native tool-calling primary + a wired JSON-structured-output fallback** (switch a node
> to structured-output if measured format-validity < ~90%) — see §10 Q3.

### 2.3 Deterministic nodes & the coexistence dispatch (FR-3)

The executor dispatches on `Step.type`:
- `type == 'agent'` → the LLM-native agent loop (§2.2).
- `type ∈ {prompt, tool, message, decision, human, wait}` → the **deterministic handler** —
  for this first cut a thin, honest seam: `message`/`prompt` post/complete via existing services;
  `wait`/`human` suspend; `decision`/`tool` land as documented stubs (`NotImplementedError` with a
  clear message) since the deterministic business-process proof is out of scope. The seam exists so a
  single workflow can mix LLM-native and deterministic nodes structurally, without building the full
  typed-step library now.

Transition guards dispatch the same way on the guard's serialized `kind` (§2.5).

### 2.4 Suspend / resume — the intake loop (AC-2)

AC-2 requires the intake node to post a clarifying question, **not advance**, and later advance when
it judges it has enough info. This is a **suspend-on-waiting-for-human-input** mechanic (distinct from
the FR-5d approval hand-off, which is deferred):

- Intake is the only step in the triage flow with `config.waitsForHuman: true` (§2.2). Its agent loop
  posts a clarifying question via `post_message`, then its single outgoing guard `"enough info to
  proceed?"` (LLM-judged, §2.5) is evaluated against `ctx` + thread.
- **Guard false + `waitsForHuman`** → §2.1 **outcome B** → the executor sets `status = waiting`,
  leaves `AT_STEP` on intake, and returns (releasing the background task). The run is now parked.
- **Resume trigger (M2 — one rule, mirrored in §6):** a subsequent **human** message
  (`role != 'assistant'`) **in the run's thread resumes the run with no re-`@mention` required**.
  Resume is checked **before** the `@mention` gate (see the ordered sequence in §6); the `@mention`
  requirement applies only to *starting* a run, never to answering an intake question. This is what
  keeps AC-2's natural conversational flow: the agent asks, the human answers in plain conversation,
  and the parked run picks the reply up. The message-post background path looks up a `waiting` run
  associated with the thread (via `TRIGGERED_BY`'s thread, or a denormalized `waitingThreadId` on the
  run for an index-anchored lookup) and re-enters the executor, which re-runs intake (now seeing the
  new reply in its context) and re-evaluates the guard.
- **Guard true** → §2.1 outcome A → transition to research → the loop continues.

Resume must be **loop-guarded exactly like the responder** (never resume on an agent-authored
message, `role != 'assistant'`) and must be single-flighted (a `running` run is not re-entered
concurrently — the `waiting → running` status flip is the guard; the graph-dba gate makes the flip a
guarded single-query CAS so two concurrent replies cannot both resume).

> **Only `waitsForHuman` steps can be resumed by a reply.** A `waiting` run always sits on a step
> that declared the flag, so a human reply is guaranteed to have something to unblock. Non-waiting
> nodes never enter `waiting` (§2.1 outcome C), so the resume path can never find a run parked on a
> step no human can advance.

### 2.5 Fuzzy guard evaluation (FR-2) & deterministic coexistence

`TRANSITION.guard` is already an opaque, set-on-create string (QUERIES §11.1) — **no schema change**.
Its content becomes a serialized JSON discriminator (parsed app-side only):

```jsonc
{ "kind": "llm",  "text": "the user has given enough information to research the request" }
""  /* empty = unconditional/default transition (fires whenever reached — lowest priority) */
```

Guard evaluation (`guards.evaluate_guard(guard, *, ctx, run, step_output, thread)`) dispatches on the
serialized `kind`, and in this cut resolves to exactly **two** live branches plus a raising seam:
- **Unconditional (empty guard `""`)** → fires whenever the transition is reached (lowest priority).
  This is how **deterministic** transitions are expressed in the triage flow — including the **D5**
  research→answer transition, which is unconditional (see below).
- `kind == 'llm'` → build a **judge prompt** (the guard `text` + the relevant run context/thread
  slice) and ask the LLM for a **structured boolean verdict + rationale**. The rationale is traced
  (FR-4). The judge prompt design, the context window fed to it, calibration, and the
  ambiguous-verdict policy are delivered by the DS note (§10) — the executor treats the judge as an
  injected callable so it is stub-testable offline.
- **Any other `kind` (e.g. a would-be `expr`) → a pure `NotImplementedError` seam (M7).** The
  stakeholder reframed the §13 open question to "LLM, not an expression library," so we deliberately
  do **not** build an expression evaluator, and the triage proof exercises **no** `expr` guard (its
  deterministic transitions are the empty-string unconditional form, not `expr`). To avoid shipping an
  untested speculative branch, `expr`/unknown kinds dispatch straight to a clear `NotImplementedError`
  — the honest coexistence seam FR-3 asks for, with **zero dead code**. A full `expr` evaluator is a
  deferred slice; do not implement it here.
- Guards are evaluated in `TRANSITION.order`; the first firing guard wins (deterministic tie-break).

**D5 — research→answer is UNCONDITIONAL, not LLM-judged (locked by the user).** A fuzzy
research→answer guard could return `false` with **no human in the loop to unblock it** — a silent
park (§2.1 outcome B is impossible there since research is not `waitsForHuman`, so it would instead
re-loop against the step budget, §2.1 outcome C). Both are wasteful. The research node instead decides
sufficiency **internally** via its own abstention (§4/§10 Q2), and the research→answer transition is a
plain unconditional (empty) guard that fires as soon as research produces findings. Only the
**intake→research** guard is fuzzy/LLM-judged. `evaluate_guard` still supports the `llm` kind
generally (a future def may LLM-judge a *human-unblockable* gate), but the triage def uses it on
intake→research **only** (§8).

## 3. Graph / data-model changes (on top of DESIGN §6)

Most of the run/step-run DDL is **already provisioned** (verified in `bootstrap_schema.sh`):
`WorkflowRun.runId` index+UNIQUE, `WorkflowRun.status` index, `StepRun.stepRunId` index+UNIQUE,
`StepRun.status` index, `Step.stepUid`/`Step.key` indexes+constraint. The additions this feature
needs:

| Change | Where | DDL? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Step.type` gains `'agent'` (LLM-native) | `services.STEP_TYPES` whitelist | no | `type` is opaque in-graph; one-line whitelist add. |
| `Step.config` carries the LLM-native bounds (systemPrompt/tools/permissions/waitsForHuman/maxIterations) as serialized JSON | write path unchanged | no | opaque string, parsed app-side only (rule 8). **`MAX_CONFIG_LEN` stays 8000 (M6, resolved)** — it already exists (`schemas.py:39,45,55`) and 8000 chars comfortably fits a node system prompt; **no bump, no RAM change**. |
| `TRANSITION.guard` carries `{kind,…}` JSON | write path unchanged | no | opaque, set-on-create; `_serialize_opaque` already JSON-encodes dicts. |
| `WorkflowRun` props: `trace` (debug flag), `maxSteps`, `stepCount`, `waitingThreadId` (denorm for resume lookup) | run write path | no (props additive) | `status` index already exists; `waitingThreadId` lookup can ride an existing anchor (see risk §9). |
| `WorkflowRun -[:TRIGGERED_BY]-> Message` | run start write | no (edge) | DESIGN §6.2; new edge type in the ws graph. |
| **`WorkflowRun -[:LAST_STEP_RUN]-> StepRun` tail pointer (M4)** | run start + each advance | no (edge) | **The `NEXT` anchor** — mirrors the locked `Thread` HEAD/TAIL pattern (DESIGN §5.2 / QUERIES §4). `record_step_and_advance` reads it to find the previous StepRun for the `NEXT` append and relinks it to the new StepRun in the **same** query → O(1) atomic advance, no chain-walk / label-scan. RAM: **one edge per run** (the tail moves, it does not accumulate) — a trivial additive line (rule 6); graph-dba confirms in the U1 RAM delta. graph-dba authors the actual Cypher at the U2 gate. |
| **StepRun → Message emission edge** | step emit write | no (edge) | DESIGN §6.2 names it `EMITTED`, but **`EMITTED` is already the K-013 `Message→Message` provenance edge** (QUERIES §10). **Disambiguate at the graph-dba gate** — recommend a distinct type (e.g. `PRODUCED`) for StepRun→Message to avoid the overload; final call is the gate's. |
| **`TraceEvent` node + `StepRun -[:TRACED]-> TraceEvent`** (debug-only) | tracer write | **yes** — `TraceEvent.traceId` index **then** UNIQUE constraint (index-before-constraint, §7.1) | New node type. RAM: **debug runs only** — call it out (§9). |

**RAM impact (rule 6).** Run/step-run nodes are the M3 per-workspace hot-growth line (execution
traces, DESIGN §3) — a run is `1 WorkflowRun + N StepRun + N-1 NEXT + a few edges`, bounded by step
count. `TraceEvent` is the larger line but is **gated to debug instances**: a debug run writes one
`TraceEvent` per LLM prompt/response, tool call/result, guard judgment, and retrieval — dozens per
run. Non-debug runs write **zero** trace nodes. Recommend: keep `TraceEvent.payload` a flat
serialized string (rule 8), cap its length at the write boundary, and note debug-run retention as an
open lever (§9). No change touches the M2 vector line.

**Single-`GRAPH.QUERY` atomicity (rule 4).** Every state-moving write is one query — the graph-dba
gate authors and PROFILE-verifies these shapes (QUERIES new **§12**), 1:1 with new `repository.py`
methods:

- **`start_run`** — CREATE `WorkflowRun {runId,defKey,defVersion,status:'running',startedAt,ctx,trace,maxSteps,stepCount:0,waitingThreadId}`, `OF_DEF`→snapshot, `AT_STEP`→start `Step`, `TRIGGERED_BY`→trigger `Message`. (No `LAST_STEP_RUN` yet — the tail edge is created by the first `record_step_and_advance`.) Backed by the `WorkflowRun.runId` UNIQUE constraint. Single query.
- **`record_step_and_advance`** — CREATE `StepRun` (constraint-backed), `RAN`→Step, `HAS_STEP_RUN`; **hang `NEXT` from the previous StepRun located via the `WorkflowRun -[:LAST_STEP_RUN]-> StepRun` tail pointer (M4)** — no chain-walk, no label scan; then **move the tail** (drop the old `LAST_STEP_RUN`, create a new one to the just-created StepRun), exactly like the `Thread` HEAD/TAIL relink; **relink** `AT_STEP` (drop old, create new to the `to` step); `SET run.stepCount = run.stepCount + 1`. The first advance in a run finds no `LAST_STEP_RUN` (so no `NEXT`) and just seeds the tail. All in **one query** (atomicity — rule 4). graph-dba PROFILEs it as edge-anchored at U2.
- **`suspend_run`** / **`resume_run`** — status flips `running↔waiting`, guarded (CAS on current status so concurrent replies can't double-resume). Single query.
- **`complete_run`** / **`fail_run`** — status → `done`/`failed`, clear `AT_STEP` (or leave for audit — gate decides).
- **`link_step_emission`** — StepRun→(`PRODUCED`)→Message. The chat message itself is posted via the existing guarded §4 write (`services.post_agent_answer`, single query); linking the emission is a **second** query (accepted two-step, like two-phase materialize — the message is the durable artifact; a missing link is a diagnosable, retry-able gap, not a torn thread). Note explicitly.
- **Reads:** `get_run`, `read_step_runs` (NEXT-ordered audit trail), `find_waiting_run_for_thread` (resume lookup), `read_trace` (debug reconstruction).

---

## 4. Node capabilities (FR-5)

Capabilities are exposed to LLM-native nodes as **tools** in a `ToolRegistry` (`tools.py`); a node's
`config.tools` list is the author-set fence (AC-6). Each tool is a typed callable the executor
dispatches when the LLM calls it, with the result traced (debug). Built-in tools for the first cut:

- **`post_message` (FR-5a)** — posts into the run's thread by reusing the existing guarded §4 write.
  Posts **as the workflow agent** (`services.post_agent_answer` with the agent actor, role derived
  `assistant`), and the executor links the emission StepRun→`PRODUCED`→Message (§3). The message is
  visible to participants as the run executes (FR-5a). Provenance seeds are attached when the post
  follows a retrieval (reuse the §10 EMITTED Message→Message provenance the responder already writes).
- **`graphrag_retrieve` (FR-5b)** — the LLM calls this with a **text** query, but
  `services.hybrid_search` takes a **query vector** `q_vec` (`services.py:381-383`), so the tool
  **depends on an injected `Embedder`** (`M5`): it embeds the query string (`embedder.embed(text)`,
  exactly as `responder.py:96-99` does) **then** calls `hybrid_search`. `ToolRegistry` wires the
  `Embedder` into this tool at construction (U9). **Precondition (AC-3):** the served app must run at
  the workspace's embedding dimension (`ws:acme` = 1024, per AGENTS.md) or the ANN silently returns
  nothing. Returns ranked seeds (msgId, text, score). **Relevance thresholding / seed count is
  delivered by the DS note** (§10, `m3-executor-ml.md` Q2): distance cutoff **τ≈0.5** (a calibration
  starting point, not a shipped constant), cap **5** / floor **1**, and **abstain** (findings =
  "no relevant context") when nothing passes τ — the research node applies this instead of the
  responder's raw-`k=10` anti-pattern.
- **`call_tool` / MCP-client (FR-5c)** — **scoped for the first cut**: land the tool-dispatch
  abstraction so *any* registered tool (built-in or MCP-exposed) is uniform to the node, and land an
  **MCP-client seam** (`tools.McpToolClient`) that can list+call tools on an external MCP server —
  **verified against a stub/in-memory MCP server in tests only**. Wiring a *real* external MCP server
  into the proof flow is **deferred** (the triage flow needs no external tool). This satisfies FR-5c
  as a present, tested capability without taking on external-integration surface now. (falkor-chat is
  today an MCP *server*, DESIGN §15; this adds the *client* direction — note the new dependency
  direction, no conflict with the server front door.)
- **`human_handoff` (FR-5d)** — the capability is registered (a tool that suspends the run pending a
  designated human's input) but **not granted to any triage node** — present, not exercised (per the
  requirements). Distinct from the intake wait-for-reply (§2.4), which is guard-driven suspend, not a
  handoff tool.

---

## 5. Tracing / serviceability (FR-4 / AC-5)

Tracing is **per-run-instance** and a primary value. `WorkflowRun.trace` (set at start — a debug
instance is started with `trace: true`) gates all trace writes. The executor holds an injected
`Tracer` with two implementations:

- **`NullTracer`** (non-debug) — records nothing; the run executes leanly. AC-5's negative half
  (a non-debug run records **no** rationale) is satisfied by construction.
- **`GraphTracer`** (debug) — writes a `TraceEvent` per recorded aspect via `StepRun -[:TRACED]->
  TraceEvent {traceId, seq, kind, at, payload}` (§3). `kind ∈ {node_rationale, guard_judgment,
  tool_call, tool_result, graphrag_retrieval, llm_prompt, llm_response, step_timing}`. `payload` is a
  flat serialized string (the prompt text, the tool args/result, the guard verdict + **why**, the
  retrieval seeds+scores, timing/status). `seq` orders events within a StepRun; the `NEXT` StepRun
  chain orders across steps — together they let a run be **fully reconstructed** after the fact
  (`repository.read_trace(runId)`), which is exactly FR-4's "reconstruct and diagnose."

The tracer is called at every seam already named in §2 (node loop, guard eval, tool dispatch,
retrieval). Because it is an injected interface, debug-vs-lean is one wiring choice and the executor
code carries no `if debug:` branches beyond obtaining the tracer.

**AC-5 test:** a debug run records `guard_judgment`/`node_rationale` events; the same flow started
non-debug records none (assert zero `TraceEvent` for that run).

---

## 6. Trigger (FR-7 / AC-1) & reconciliation with `AgentResponder`

Today: `api.post_message` schedules `_safe_respond` on `BackgroundTasks`, and `AgentResponder.
maybe_respond` posts a **direct** retrieval-grounded reply when the message @mentions the agent and
is not agent-authored (`responder.py`). The workflow trigger does **not** slot in as an independent
peer to `_safe_respond` — that would fire **both** on an `@mention` (double response, **M3**).
Instead the trigger **owns the responder fall-through**: it holds the `AgentResponder` and invokes it
only when no workflow handles the request, so **exactly one** of {workflow, direct reply} runs per
message.

**Trigger decision sequence (single ordered rule — M2/M3 reconciled; mirrors §2.4).**
`WorkflowTrigger.maybe_trigger(ctx, *, thread_id, msg_id, role, mentions)` runs, in order:

1. **loop-guard** — if `role == 'assistant'`, do nothing (never act on an agent-authored message).
2. **resume-if-waiting** — if a `waiting` run is associated with this thread (§2.4), **resume** it
   with this human reply (guarded CAS `waiting→running`). **No `@mention` required** — this is the
   step that keeps AC-2's natural flow (M2). Return; do **not** fall through to the responder.
3. **@mention-to-start** — else, if the message @mentions the agent **and** a triage workflow is
   configured for the workspace (`FALKORCHAT_TRIGGER_DEF_KEY`), **start** a `WorkflowRun` for that
   def's materialized snapshot, linked `TRIGGERED_BY` the triggering message (AC-1), and run the
   executor loop out-of-band. Return; do **not** also invoke the responder.
4. **fall-through** — else (no waiting run, and either no @mention or no workflow configured), invoke
   the held **`AgentResponder`** so M2 direct-reply behavior is preserved exactly. The responder
   keeps its own `@mention` guard, so a non-mention message that reaches step 4 is a no-op there.

**Wiring (M3 — exactly one background handler).** When `WORKFLOW_ENABLED`, `app._build_default_app`
registers **only** `_safe_run_workflow` and passes the `AgentResponder` **into** `WorkflowTrigger`
(for step 4). `_safe_respond` is **not** separately registered in that mode — so an `@mention` can
never trigger both a workflow and a direct reply. When `WORKFLOW_ENABLED` is off (the default), the
M2 wiring is **unchanged**: `_safe_respond` is registered as today and no trigger exists — keeping the
network-free pytest baseline and the M2 direct-responder path untouched. The executor runs on
`BackgroundTasks` (out-of-band, like the responder), so its LLM latency never blocks the poster — and
a `waiting` run simply returns, to be resumed by the next reply.

This keeps the trigger seam consistent with M2 (loop-guarded, out-of-band, failure-isolated) while
guaranteeing one handler per request, and lets workflow-mode and direct-reply-mode coexist behind
config.

## 7. Runaway-loop safety (the parked open question)

Every node and guard is an LLM call, so an unbounded loop is a real risk. Design decision — **two
nested bounds, no wall-clock/token budget** (the requirements explicitly set no cost budget):

1. **Run-level step budget** — `WorkflowRun.maxSteps` (**per-def default `12`, global hard ceiling
   `25`** — DS note Q4, §10). `record_step_and_advance` increments `stepCount`; when
   `stepCount > maxSteps` the executor transitions the run to `status = 'failed'` with a
   `TraceEvent`/`ctx` note ("step budget exceeded"). This is the primary runaway guard, and the
   backstop for a `type:'agent'` step re-looping under §2.1 outcome C.
2. **Per-node iteration cap** — `config.maxIterations` (**default `4`** for the tool-light proof
   nodes; the DS note keeps `6` only as an upper bound for a wider-fenced future node) bounds a single
   LLM-native node's tool-calling loop, so one node cannot spin forever calling tools. On exhaustion
   the node terminates with its best current text + a trace note (graceful — it does **not** hard-fail
   the run); only `maxSteps` exceeded fails the run.

**Not** a "never revisit a step" rule — the intake self-loop (AC-2, via §2.1 outcome B resume) and a
non-waiting node's re-execution (§2.1 outcome C) are *legitimate* cycles; the step budget (which
counts every StepRun including re-runs) is the correct bound. A `waiting` run consumes no budget while
parked (only executed steps count). Tracing (FR-4) aids diagnosis but, as the requirements note, does
not prevent loops — the budget does. Defaults come from the DS note (§10 Q4), coupled to the judge/
agent reliability gates — do not raise them to paper over a failing calibration.

---

## 8. Sequencing, file-by-file changes & interfaces

Phased so the tree stays buildable/green and each phase is reviewable. The component convention holds:
**graph-dba gate** (verified Cypher into `QUERIES.md` §12 + `test_queries.sh` assertions raising the
193 baseline, enumerated; `bootstrap_schema.sh` for the `TraceEvent` DDL; DESIGN §6/§13 updates) →
**tdd-engineer** (executor + services + tools + trigger). The DS note (§10) folds in at Phase 2.

**Phase 0 — graph-dba gate (data model + queries).**
- `bootstrap_schema.sh`: add `TraceEvent.traceId` index **then** UNIQUE (index-before-constraint).
  Confirm the resume lookup (`find_waiting_run_for_thread`) plans as an index scan — either via
  `TRIGGERED_BY`→Message→Thread traversal or a `WorkflowRun.waitingThreadId` value + the existing
  `status` index (gate PROFILEs and picks; may add a `waitingThreadId` index if needed — call out RAM).
- `QUERIES.md` §12: `start_run`, `record_step_and_advance`, `suspend/resume` (guarded CAS),
  `complete/fail_run`, `link_step_emission` (resolve the `EMITTED` overload → recommend `PRODUCED`),
  `get_run`, `read_step_runs`, `find_waiting_run_for_thread`, `read_trace`. Each live-verified +
  PROFILEd; each state-move is a single query.
- `test_queries.sh`: enumerated contract assertions (start creates the run subgraph; advance moves
  AT_STEP + appends NEXT + bumps stepCount atomically; suspend/resume CAS; step-budget fail;
  emission link; trace write/read; index-scan profiles). Gate pins the new count (193 → ~N).
- DESIGN §6.1/§6.2 (add `type:'agent'` + config shape incl. `waitsForHuman`, the guard `{kind}`
  discriminator, `trace`/`maxSteps`/`stepCount`, `TraceEvent`/`TRACED`, the emission edge name, and
  the **`LAST_STEP_RUN` tail edge**), and **§13** (mark the guard open question **resolved** —
  LLM-native + coexist, superseding "guard is an expression"). **M8 doc-sync in the same pass:** add
  `stepRunId` to the DESIGN §6.2 `StepRun` property list (it is indexed+constrained in
  `bootstrap_schema.sh`) and refresh the stale `test_queries.sh` "(126/126)" count in DESIGN §7.1 to
  the new pinned number.

**Phase 1 — executor core (deterministic, offline).**
- `repository.py`: run/step-run/trace methods (1:1 §12) + typed errors (`WorkflowRunNotFoundError`,
  `StepBudgetExceededError`).
- `executor.py` — `WorkflowExecutor(services, repo, *, llm, guard_judge, tool_registry, tracer,
  step_budget)`; the §2.1 loop with a **stub step handler + stub guard** so the whole engine
  (advance, NEXT trace, AT_STEP relink, suspend/resume, step budget, done/fail) is unit-testable with
  **no LLM/network** (deterministic transitions).
- `services.py`: `start_workflow_run(ctx, *, def_key, version, trigger_msg_id, trace)`,
  `resume_workflow_run(ctx, *, run_id, ...)`, run/step-run/trace reads; lock the **`start_key`
  contract** (slice-1 residual — the start step is the one with `start: True`; confirm and keep).
- pytest: executor units (drive intake-wait→resume→research→answer→done with stub handlers), audit
  trail, step-budget abort, suspend/resume CAS, tracing on/off (AC-5).

**Phase 2 — LLM-native execution + fuzzy guards (folds in the DS note §10).**
- `llm.py`: extend the seam with `chat(messages, tools) -> ChatResult` (tool-calls or text) on
  `LMStudioLLM`; keep `complete` for the responder.
- `guards.py`: `evaluate_guard` (LLM-judge via an injected judge callable + the deterministic seam);
  the judge prompt per the DS note.
- `executor._run_agent_node`: the §2.2 bounded tool-scoped agent loop; AC-6 scope enforcement.
- pytest: agent-node loop with a stub tool-calling LLM; guard-judge with a stub judge (verdict +
  rationale traced); AC-6 (ungranted tool rejected).

**Phase 3 — node capabilities + tools.**
- `tools.py`: `ToolRegistry`, built-in `post_message`/`graphrag_retrieve`/`human_handoff`, and
  `McpToolClient` (MCP-client seam) tested against a stub MCP server.
- Emission linking (StepRun→`PRODUCED`→Message) after the §4 post.
- pytest: each tool dispatches + traces; MCP-client against the stub; retrieve applies the DS
  threshold.

**Phase 4 — trigger + resume wiring.**
- `trigger.py` — `WorkflowTrigger.maybe_trigger` (§6); resume-before-start; fall through to
  `AgentResponder` when no workflow configured.
- `api.py`: `_safe_run_workflow` background handler (config-gated); `app._build_default_app` wires the
  trigger when enabled. Optional REST for run inspection (`GET /workflow-runs/{runId}`,
  `.../step-runs`, `.../trace`) via thin service pass-throughs (follows §14.4 pattern).
- `config.py`: `TRIGGER_DEF_KEY`, `WORKFLOW_ENABLED` flags (default off — network-free baseline
  preserved). `schemas.py`: run-start/inspect request models (size-bounded, rule 6).
- pytest: trigger starts a run + links `TRIGGERED_BY`; resume path; fall-through to responder.

**Phase 5 — triage proof flow (§9 below) + acceptance.**
- `scripts/seed_workflows.sh` (mirrors `seed_demo.sh`): publish the triage def, materialize into
  `ws:acme` (additive-only), register the trigger. Idempotent.
- One live-marked end-to-end test (real LM Studio, like the M2 responder smoke) exercising
  AC-1…AC-4; the rest of the acceptance is K-025 (qa-engineer).

**Layering stays locked:** `api.py`/`mcp.py` thin adapters → `services.py` → `repository.py` (Cypher
1:1 with `QUERIES.md`); tenant seam `config.get_context`. `executor.py`/`tools.py`/`guards.py`/
`trigger.py` are new domain modules the services layer orchestrates.

### The triage proof flow (AC-1…AC-4) mapped to the model

`kind: 'conversation'`, three `type:'agent'` steps + guards:

| Step (`type:'agent'`) | `config` flags | systemPrompt (plain language) | tools | outgoing guard |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **intake** (start) | `waitsForHuman: true` | "Ask the user clarifying questions until you can state their request precisely; ask one question at a time." | `post_message` | `{kind:'llm', text:"the user has provided enough information to research their request"}` → **research**; false + `waitsForHuman` → **suspend/`waiting`** (§2.1 outcome B, AC-2) |
| **research** | — (no wait) | "Retrieve relevant context from the workspace and produce concise findings grounded only in what you retrieve; if nothing relevant is found, say so." | `graphrag_retrieve` | **`""` unconditional (D5)** → **answer** — fires as soon as findings exist; sufficiency is the node's own abstention (§4/§10 Q2), **not** an LLM guard (no human to unblock a suspend here) |
| **answer** | — (no wait) | "Post a reply to the thread that answers the user's request, grounded in the research findings; cite what you used." | `post_message` | terminal (no outgoing transitions) → §2.1 outcome C → run `done` (AC-4) |

- AC-1: @mention starts the run, `TRIGGERED_BY` the message. AC-2: intake posts a question and
  **suspends** (only intake sets `waitsForHuman`), resuming on the next human reply **without a
  re-`@mention`** (§2.4/§6) until the fuzzy intake→research guard fires. AC-3: research retrieves via
  GraphRAG over **seeded** conversation data (the seed script/QA create it — a test precondition, not
  this plan), applies the DS threshold/abstention, and advances **unconditionally** (D5). AC-4: answer
  posts a grounded reply, terminal → run `done`. No human approval (AC-4 simplified).

## 9. Risks, open questions & contradictions to flag

- **DESIGN §6.1/§13 reconciliation (not a locked-decision violation).** §6.1 says
  "`TRANSITION.guard` is an expression evaluated against run context" and §13 lists the
  expr-lib-vs-DSL open question. The stakeholder-confirmed requirements **reframe/resolve** this to
  LLM-judged guards (coexisting with a deterministic seam). This is authorized by the requirements,
  but it supersedes wording in DESIGN — **update §6.1/§13 in the same change** (do not silently leave
  the old wording). Rule 8 ("never filter inside serialized `config`/`guard`") is **respected** — the
  `{kind}` discriminator is parsed app-side, never in Cypher.
- **LLM function-calling reliability on the local 4B model** (§2.2) — the executor's agent loop and
  the tool-scope enforcement depend on the model emitting well-formed tool calls. Verify against LM
  Studio; if unreliable, fall back to JSON-structured-output prompting. **Resolved by the DS note
  (§10, delivered): native-primary + structured-output fallback, per-node format-validity gate.**
- **`EMITTED` edge overload** — DESIGN §6.2 names StepRun→Message `EMITTED`, but K-013 already uses
  `EMITTED` for Message→Message provenance (QUERIES §10). Recommend a distinct type (`PRODUCED`) for
  the StepRun sense; the graph-dba gate makes the final call and updates both DESIGN and QUERIES.
- **`TraceEvent` RAM & retention** (rule 6) — debug-only, but "trace all aspects" is verbose. Cap
  `payload` length; treat debug-run trace retention as an open lever (align with the §13 retention
  question). Non-debug runs write zero trace nodes — the default stays lean.
- **Resume lookup index** — `find_waiting_run_for_thread` must be index-anchored (not a
  `WorkflowRun` label scan). The gate PROFILEs the `TRIGGERED_BY`-traversal vs a denormalized
  `waitingThreadId` value; a new index is a small additive RAM line if needed.
- **Concurrent replies to a waiting run** — the `waiting → running` flip must be a guarded single-query
  CAS so two near-simultaneous human replies cannot both resume the same run (double execution).
- **Two-step emission link** (post message, then link StepRun→Message) is non-atomic across the two
  queries; accepted — the message is the durable artifact, a missing link is diagnosable/retry-able,
  not a torn thread. Documented.
- **Authz for global def publish / who may start a run** — inherits the M1 single-hardcoded-tenant
  seam (unauthenticated like everything else); ties to deferred K-016 auth. Non-blocking; note it.
- **Scope honesty** — this is a multi-slice feature (executor + trigger linkage + conversational
  proof). If the reviewer/orchestrator wants it delivered in smaller increments, Phases 0–3
  (executor + capabilities, offline-testable) form a green, self-contained first landing; Phases 4–5
  (trigger + proof) are the second. Flagged for the coordinator.

### Test strategy (altitudes)

- **Contract** (`test_queries.sh`, graph-dba gate): §12 run/step-run/trace queries — start subgraph,
  atomic advance (AT_STEP relink + NEXT + stepCount in one query), suspend/resume CAS, step-budget
  fail, emission link, trace write/read, and `Node By Index Scan` PROFILE assertions. Enumerated
  193 → ~N (gate pins).
- **Unit** (pytest, offline): executor loop with stub handlers/guards (advance, audit trail,
  suspend/resume, step budget, done/fail); agent-node loop with a stub tool-calling LLM; guard-judge
  with a stub judge (AC-2 verdict + rationale); AC-6 tool-scope rejection; AC-5 tracing on vs off
  (TraceEvent count); each tool dispatch + trace; MCP-client against a stub MCP server.
- **Integration** (pytest against `ws:test`): publish+materialize the triage def, start a run, drive
  it end-to-end with a stub LLM/judge; assert `TRIGGERED_BY`, the StepRun NEXT trace, and `done`.
- **Live** (behind a marker, like the M2 responder smoke): a real LM Studio triage run exercising
  AC-1…AC-4. Full acceptance is K-025 (qa-engineer).
- **Baselines stay green:** `test_queries.sh` at the new enumerated count; pytest ≥ 196; the
  default app import + baseline stay network-free (workflow trigger config-gated, like the M2 agent).

## 10. Data-scientist method note — `docs/plans/m3-executor-ml.md` (DELIVERED)

The ML-methodology core of this feature is answered by the **data-scientist** method note at
**`docs/plans/m3-executor-ml.md`** (delivered 2026-07-10; builds on `docs/plans/graphrag-eval-ml.md`).
It folds into the build at **Phase 2** and gates units U6–U8. **Do not re-derive the method here** —
the note is the source of truth for the numbers and prompt designs; this section only names the seams
that consume it and the decisions already folded into the plan above:

1. **Fuzzy-guard judge (FR-2/AC-2)** → note **Q1**: **extract-then-judge** (the intake node emits an
   `{request, known, missing}` `understanding` object; a *separate* minimal judge call scores the
   guard against it, not the raw transcript), output schema **`{decision, rationale}`**, a **calibrated
   golden set** (`golden_guards.jsonl`, κ ≥ 0.6 / false-advance ≤ 10% gate), **bias-to-suspend** on
   ambiguity for the intake guard, and a **3-round clarifying ceiling** in `ctx`. Consumed by
   `guards.evaluate_guard(judge=…)` (injected, stub-testable). Note Q1 also independently recommends
   the research→answer transition be **unconditional** — now locked as **D5** (§2.5/§8).
2. **Research-node grounding (FR-5b/AC-3)** → note **Q2**: distance-cutoff **τ≈0.5** (a calibration
   starting point), **cap 5 / floor 1**, **abstain** when nothing passes τ, grounding-strict +
   citation-forcing node prompt, and the **recall@5 (primary) / MRR / faithfulness** eval on the
   seeded corpus. Consumed by the `graphrag_retrieve` tool (§4, injected `Embedder` + threshold).
3. **Agent-loop tool-calling (§2.2 risk)** → note **Q3**: **native tool-calling primary, JSON
   structured-output as the wired fallback**, minimal 1–2-tool fences, name-against-granted-set +
   schema validation with a bounded re-prompt, switch a node to structured-output if format-validity
   < ~90%. Consumed by `llm.chat(messages, tools)` (U6) and `executor._run_agent_node` (U8).
4. **Runaway-safety defaults (§7)** → note **Q4**: **`maxSteps` = 12** (per-def default; global hard
   ceiling 25) and **`maxIterations` = 4** — already folded into §7 and the §2.2 config example below.

The seams stay explicit so these drop in without reshaping the executor: `guards.evaluate_guard` takes
an injected judge, `graphrag_retrieve` an injected retriever+threshold, and the LLM seam is swappable.
**Open decision surfaced by the note (already resolved):** OQ6 (research→answer judged vs
unconditional) → resolved **unconditional** by the user as **D5**.

## Ready to implement — summary

**Plan:** `falkor-chat/docs/plans/m3-executor.md`

**What it is.** The M3 LLM-native workflow executor (K-022, reframed to the stakeholder-confirmed
`llm-native-workflows` requirements): a run/step-run engine where an LLM-native node (`type:'agent'`)
runs as a bounded, author-tool-scoped agent loop, transitions are LLM-judged fuzzy guards
(deterministic step/guard **dispatch seam** kept so both coexist — FR-3), the intake loop
suspends/resumes on human replies (AC-2), nodes post/retrieve/call-tools (incl. an **MCP-client**
seam, scoped to a stubbed first cut) — FR-5, per-run debug tracing records **all aspects** into
`TraceEvent`s (FR-4/AC-5), @mention **triggers** a run via `TRIGGERED_BY` reconciled with the
existing `AgentResponder` (FR-7/AC-1), and a run-level step budget + per-node iteration cap bound
runaway loops (§7). Delivers the **triage proof flow** intake→research→answer (AC-1…AC-4).

**Key decisions:** `Step.type:'agent'` + opaque-JSON `config` for the LLM-native bounds incl. the
explicit **`waitsForHuman`** suspend flag (no DDL — rule 8 respected); guard is either the empty-string
**unconditional** form or `{kind:'llm'}` — the **`expr` kind is a pure `NotImplementedError` seam** (no
dead code, M7); new debug-only `TraceEvent`/`TRACED` (new DDL, index-before-constraint); **`WorkflowRun
-[:LAST_STEP_RUN]-> StepRun` tail pointer** anchors the atomic `NEXT` advance (M4, mirrors Thread HEAD/
TAIL); StepRun→Message emission as a **distinct `PRODUCED`** edge (avoids the K-013 `EMITTED` overload);
suspend/resume via a guarded `waiting↔running` CAS with resume **before** the @mention gate (M2);
**exactly one background handler** per request — the trigger owns the responder fall-through (M3);
**research→answer unconditional** (D5); DS-derived defaults **`maxSteps` 12 / `maxIterations` 4**;
**§13 guard open question resolved** (LLM, not an expr lib — reconcile DESIGN §6.1/§6.2/§13).

**Handoff order:** graph-dba gate (Phase 0/U1–U2: `TraceEvent` + `LAST_STEP_RUN` DDL, §12 queries incl.
edge-anchored `record_step_and_advance`, `test_queries.sh` 193→~N, DESIGN §6/§7.1/§13 incl. M8 sync) →
tdd-engineer/coder (Phases 1–5, per the coordination-doc units). The **data-scientist note**
`m3-executor-ml.md` is **delivered** (§10) and consumed at Phase 2.

**Decision/uncertainty flags:** (a) DESIGN §6.1/§6.2/§13 wording superseded by the reframe — update in
the same change (authorized D1, flagged). (b) LLM function-calling reliability on the local 4B — DS note
Q3 sets native-primary + structured-output fallback, verify against LM Studio. (c) `EMITTED` overload —
`PRODUCED` locked (D2), graph-dba updates DESIGN+QUERIES. (d) Multi-slice feature — Phases 0–3 (offline
executor, U0–U10) are a clean first landing; 4–5 (trigger + proof, U11–U15) the second. (e) The DS
judge-calibration gate (κ ≥ 0.6 / false-advance ≤ 10%) is the executor's reliability gate — if it fails,
the fuzzy intake guard should not ship live on the 4B (escalate to a stronger judge / more concrete
guard text), not be papered over by `maxSteps`. Baselines stay green; default app import stays
network-free (trigger config-gated).

## Changelog — 2026-07-10 plan-patch (closing the analyst review `docs/reviews/m3-executor.md`)

Targeted revision, no redesign. Sections touched and how each finding is resolved:

- **M1 (suspend semantics) — §2.1, §2.2, §2.4, §8.** Added an **explicit `waitsForHuman: true` config
  flag** as the suspend signal (replacing the undefined "wait/intake node"), and rewrote the §2.1 loop
  to define **all three outcomes** exhaustively: A advance (guard fires) / B suspend (`waitsForHuman`,
  human-unblockable only) / C re-loop-or-terminate (non-waiting: re-execute if it has outgoing
  transitions, bounded by the step budget; `done` if terminal). The previously-undefined "no guard +
  outgoing + not waiting" case is now a bounded self-loop, not an infinite park.
- **M2 (resume contradiction) — §2.4, §6.** Reconciled to one ordered rule, stated in both sections:
  `loop-guard → resume-if-waiting (no re-@mention) → @mention-to-start → fall-through`. Resume is
  checked **before** the @mention gate; @mention gates **start** only — restoring AC-2's natural flow.
- **M3 (double-response) — §6.** The trigger now **owns the responder fall-through**: when
  `WORKFLOW_ENABLED`, only `_safe_run_workflow` is registered and the `AgentResponder` is passed
  **into** `WorkflowTrigger` (step 4); `_safe_respond` is not separately registered — **exactly one
  handler per request**. Disabled mode = unchanged M2 wiring.
- **M4 (NEXT anchor) — §3.** Named the data-model decision: a **`WorkflowRun -[:LAST_STEP_RUN]->
  StepRun` tail pointer** (mirrors Thread HEAD/TAIL, DESIGN §5.2) that `record_step_and_advance` reads
  and relinks in the same query → **O(1) atomic advance**, no chain-walk/label-scan. RAM = one edge/run
  (tail moves, doesn't accumulate); graph-dba authors the Cypher + confirms RAM at U2.
- **D5 (research→answer unconditional, user-locked) — §2.5, §8, §10.** The research→answer transition
  is an **unconditional** (empty) guard — sufficiency is the research node's own abstention, not an
  LLM guard (no human to unblock a suspend there). Only intake→research is fuzzy/LLM-judged. §8 triage
  table and §2.5 updated; also partially covers M1 for research (but the general 3-outcome rule still
  stated).
- **DS note reconciled as DELIVERED — §10 (+ header, §2.2, §4, §7).** §10 now references
  `m3-executor-ml.md` as the delivered source of truth (extract-then-judge `{decision, rationale}` +
  calibrated golden set; τ≈0.5 / cap 5 / floor 1 / abstain; native tool-calling primary + structured-
  output fallback; `maxSteps` 12 / `maxIterations` 4) without restating the method. §7 defaults updated
  to 12/4; §2.2 config example updated.
- **Minors:** **M5** — §4 `graphrag_retrieve` now states it depends on an injected `Embedder` (embed
  text → `q_vec` → `hybrid_search`) + the `ws:acme` 1024-dim AC-3 precondition (→ U9). **M6** —
  `MAX_CONFIG_LEN` resolved in §3: **stays 8000, no bump, no RAM change** (→ U3). **M7** — §2.5 `expr`
  kind reduced to a **pure `NotImplementedError` seam** (no untested branch) (→ U7). **M8** — Phase 0
  bullet now folds the DESIGN §6.2 `stepRunId` add + §7.1 stale-count refresh into the graph-dba U1
  pass.

**Nothing left unclosed.** All four majors + D5 + the four minors are resolved in the doc. No new open
decision was created; the one live decision the DS note surfaced (OQ6 research→answer) is closed by D5.
