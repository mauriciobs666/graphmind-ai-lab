"""The `@mention`→workflow trigger (M3, K-023 — Phase 4 / U11, plan §6).

`WorkflowTrigger.maybe_trigger` is the single background handler the API schedules for a
posted message when the workflow engine is wired. It applies the §6 **ordered rule** so
**exactly one** of {resume, start, responder} acts on a message — the M3 "one handler per
request" guarantee (the trigger *holds* the M2 responder for its no-workflow fall-through,
so an `@mention` can never fire both a workflow and a direct reply):

  1. **loop-guard** — an agent-authored message (`role == "assistant"`) is ignored, exactly
     like the responder's loop-guard: an agent post that mentions the agent must not
     re-trigger forever.
  2. **resume-if-waiting** — if this thread has a `waiting` run, a human reply resumes it
     **without a re-@mention** (§2.4): the reply belongs to that run's intake loop.
     `resume_workflow_run` CASes `waiting→running` single-flight (§12.4) — a concurrent
     loser just no-ops; either way this branch **returns** (never falls through).
  3. **@mention-to-start** — otherwise, if the message @mentions the agent and a def is
     configured, start a fresh run of that def, triggered by this message.
  4. **fall-through** — no workflow applies: hand the message to the held M2 responder,
     which self-decides whether to answer.

Layering (AGENTS.md): the trigger orchestrates the **service layer** only — it holds no
Cypher and no executor reference (the executor is wired behind `services`). Everything is
injected so the ordered rule is unit-testable offline.
