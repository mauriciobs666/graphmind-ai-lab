"""Transition-guard evaluation (M3, K-022 — Phase 2 / U7).

A `TRANSITION.guard` is an opaque, set-on-create string (QUERIES §11.1). Its content
is a serialized discriminator, parsed **app-side only** (rule 8 — never filtered in
Cypher). `evaluate_guard` dispatches on the serialized `kind` to exactly **two** live
branches plus a raising seam (plan §2.5):

  * **Unconditional** — the empty string ``""`` fires whenever the transition is reached
    (the deterministic default; **lowest priority** — the caller orders it last). This is
    how the **D5** research→answer transition is expressed (unconditional, not LLM-judged).
  * ``{"kind":"llm","text":…}`` — the fuzzy branch: the **Q1 extract-then-judge** method
    (`docs/plans/m3-executor-ml.md`). The compact `understanding` object (`{request, known,
    missing}`) the node emitted is extracted and handed — *not the raw transcript* — to the
    **injected** `judge`, which returns a ``{decision, rationale}`` verdict. The Q1 ambiguity
    policy is applied here: parse failure / non-bool decision / a rationale that contradicts a
    `true` decision → **bias-to-suspend** (`decision=False`), safe for the human-unblockable
    intake guard (a false-suspend costs one more cheap clarifying question). The verdict +
    rationale are returned for the tracer (FR-4).
  * **Any other kind** (e.g. a would-be ``expr``) → a pure `NotImplementedError` seam (M7 —
    no dead code). A full expression evaluator is a deferred slice; do not build it here.

The judge is injected so this whole module is stub-testable offline — no LLM, no network.
The production judge (LLM-backed, building the DS §Q1 prompt) is wired in a later unit.
