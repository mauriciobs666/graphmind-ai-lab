## 2026-06-11 — K-001: `list_channels` query (list channels in a workspace)

- **What:** Authored and live-verified a `list channels` query and added it to `docs/QUERIES.md`
  §3 (Channels & threads), with assertions in `scripts/test_queries.sh`. Query:
  `MATCH (c:Channel) WHERE c.channelId > '' RETURN c.channelId, c.name, c.createdAt ORDER BY
  c.createdAt DESC LIMIT $limit`. The always-true `c.channelId > ''` predicate (every `channelId`
  is a non-empty string) anchors the listing on the **`Channel.channelId` range index** —
  `GRAPH.PROFILE` confirms `Node By Index Scan`, not `NodeByLabelScan`. Ordered by `createdAt`
  (channel **creation** time, newest-first), which is free once the scan is index-backed. Marked
  `GET /channels → list_channels` resolved in `DESIGN.md` §14.4 (was "gap — owned by graph-dba")
  and flipped the §14.6 prerequisite step to done.
- **Why:** the M1 REST surface (`GET /channels`, DESIGN §14.4) needed a verified query and
  `QUERIES.md` had none — it covered channel *members* (§2) and recent *threads* (§3) but not
  channels. Unblocks the `list_channels` repository method (§14.6 build order).
- **Trade-off noted:** true activity-recency (most-recent message/thread per channel) would need a
  `HAS_THREAD` → `Thread.updatedAt` expansion per channel — the Channel-level edge traversal §5.2
  deliberately avoids — so the cheap, index-backed **creation-time** ordering is used instead, and
  this is documented inline in `QUERIES.md`. No new index or constraint added; **zero per-workspace
  RAM cost** (reuses the existing `Channel.channelId` index).
- **Tests:** suite green at the **new baseline 64/64 → 67/67** (one §3 functional assertion +
  the standard §8 `assert_index_scan` pair; the plan's "65/65" estimate predated counting each
  `assert_*` call — the PROFILE proof is a two-line assertion per the existing §8 convention).
- **Plan items:** K-001 ✅ done.

## 2026-06-11 — Defined the M1 client/server application architecture

- **What:** Pinned the M1 application architecture and documented it as a new `docs/DESIGN.md` §14.
  Decisions: **transport = REST/JSON over FastAPI** (chosen after explicitly re-evaluating and
  rejecting gRPC — the only M1 client is a browser, so gRPC's typed-contract/streaming/service-mesh
  wins go unused and gRPC-Web would be pure bridge tax; WebSocket/SSE is the stronger M2 real-time
  path); **client = minimal web UI**; **real-time deferred to M2**; **single hardcoded tenant**
  (`ws=acme`, `user=u1`) injected at one FastAPI dependency seam so real auth drops in later without
  touching services/repo. Captured the layering (router → service → repository → db → FalkorDB),
  the REST surface → service → `QUERIES.md` mapping, proposed `server/` + `web/` layout, and the
  bottom-up TDD build order. Updated the §12 + README roadmap rows to point at §14.
- **Why:** User wanted the M1 client/server architecture nailed down before any code; the DESIGN
  doc previously only sketched the *operational* topology (§10), not the application code shape.
- **Plan items:** seeded **K-001** (`list_channels` query gap, owned by graph-dba — the one piece of
  the M1 REST surface with no verified query yet).

## 2026-06-11 — Adopted the kaizen plan/history convention

- **What:** Created `kaizen/{plan.md,history.md}` for the component, mirroring the sibling
  `claude/<agent>/kaizen/` projects (forward-looking backlog + dated change log). Replaced a
  short-lived `BACKLOG.md` draft with this structure.
- **Why:** User asked the component to track work the same way the sibling projects do, rather than
  a standalone backlog file.
- **Plan items:** K-001 recorded as the first active item.

## (prior) — M0 baseline

- M0 — Engine up: FalkorDB running (`falkordb/falkordb:edge`, Redis 8.2.2, module `999999`),
  design locked, schema bootstrap + canonical query library live-verified (`test_queries.sh`,
  64/64). Predates this log; see git history (e.g. `feat(falkor-chat): schema, query library,
  tests, and working context`) and `docs/DESIGN.md`.
